## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Discord for all online communication

* Each teammate will respond in at most 24 hours to messages

* If a teammate does not meet a deadline, they will notify the rest of the group with how much they have completed, how much is left, and find a teammate to do the work for them or let team members know how much time left they need to finish. 
* Also, if you can't attend a lecture/lab, then notify the group.

* We will allow each team member to have opportunities to contribute to projects. 
If there is an emergency with a teammate, the rest of the team will actively contribute to accommodate for this.
